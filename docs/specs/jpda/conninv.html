<h3 id="transports">Transports</h3>
<p>A Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) <em>Transport</em> is a
method of communication between a debugger and the virtual machine that
is being debugged (the <em>target VM</em>). The communication is
connection orientedâ€”one side acts as a server, listening for a
connection; the other side acts as a client and connects to the server.
JPDA allows either the debugger application or the target VM to act as
the server. Transport implementations can allow communications between
processes running on a single machine, on different machines, or either.
When establishing a connection a <em>transport address</em> is used to
identify the endpoint of the connection. The format of a transport
address depends on the type of transport.</p>
<p>Within JPDA, the debugger application uses the Java Debug Interface
(JDI) interface and the <code>Connector</code> abstraction to establish
a connection to the target VM. See the section <a
href="#connectors">Connectors</a>. The <code>Connector</code> used by
the debugger application encapsulates the transport. On the target VM,
an agent supporting the Java Debug Wire Protocol is used to communicate
with the debugger. This agent (which may be built into the target VM or
loaded from a runtime library) encapsulates the transport to communicate
with the debugger.</p>
<p>Two transport implementations are shipped with the reference
implementation: A socket transport based on TCP/IP and a shared memory
transport. The specifications do not require any specific transport
implementation to exist. In addition to transports provided with the
implementation, the architecture includes service provider interfaces to
allow additional transports be developed and deployed. See the section
<a href="#service-provider-interfaces">Service Provider
Interfaces</a>.</p>
<h4 id="socket-transport">Socket Transport</h4>
<p>The JPDA reference implementation provides a socket transport for the
Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows platforms. With the socket
transport, the debugger application and the target VM can reside either
on the same machine or on different machines. The socket transport uses
a single stream TCP/IP connection between the debugger application and
the target VM. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported on the JDI side and the
target VM side of the socket transport.</p>
<p>Command and reply packets are written to the stream in accordance
with the <a href="../jdwp/jdwp-spec.html">JDWP specification</a> using
the <a href="../jdwp/jdwp-transport.html">JDWP Transport Interface</a>.
Because many small packets can be sent over JDWP, the TCP_NO_DELAY
socket option can improve performance in some socket implementations by
avoiding delays that could occur if the socket implementation buffers
small packets before sending them. Sockets are closed gracefully so that
unsent data is sent if possible.</p>
<p>The socket transport is identified through a unique string,
<code>dt_socket</code>. This name can be used to select the socket
transport when invoking the target VM. See the section <a
href="#vm-invocation-options">VM Invocation Options</a>. Within the
debugger application a corresponding <code>Connector</code> is used
which encapsulates the socket transport.</p>
<p>Socket transport addresses have the format
<code>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;host&gt;</code>
is the host name or the IP address (may be enclosed in square brackets)
and <code>&lt;port&gt;</code> is the socket port number to attach to or
listen on. If <code>&lt;host&gt;</code> is empty, the local loopback
address is used. If <code>&lt;host&gt;</code> equals "<code>*</code>" in
contexts where a server is waiting for a client to attach, the server
listens on all network interfaces.</p>
<h4 id="shared-memory-transport">Shared Memory Transport</h4>
<p>In addition to the socket transport, the JPDA reference
implementation provides a shared memory transport on Windows. The shared
memory transport uses a shared memory region to exchange JDWP packets
between the debugger application and the target VM. With the shared
memory transport, the debugger application and target VM must reside on
the same machine.</p>
<p>The shared memory transport is identified through a unique string,
<code>dt_shmem</code>. This name can be used to select the socket
transport when invoking the target VM. See the section <a
href="#vm-invocation-options">VM Invocation Options</a>. Within the
debugger application, a corresponding <code>Connector</code> is used
which encapsulates the shared memory transport.</p>
<p>Shared memory transport addresses are simply names that can be used
as Windows file-mapping object names. The name string can consist of any
combination of characters, excluding the backslash.</p>
<h3 id="connectors">Connectors</h3>
<p>A <em>connector</em> is a JDI abstraction that is used in
establishing a connection between a debugger application (written to the
JDI) and a target VM. Different JDI implementations are free to provide
different connector implementations to match the transports and VMs they
support. The connector interfaces are very general, which allows JDI to
be used with varying connector implementations. Connectors are
configured through a set of name-value pairs. Specific connectors accept
different name-value pairs.</p>
<p>A good JDI client application allows users to choose and configure
any connector that may be present, but it can be beneficial to
incorporate knowledge of specific connectors into the debugger to make
their configuration a more pleasant user experience. The example JDB
implementation provided with the JPDA illustrates this approach. See the
section <a href="#connecting-with-jdb">Connecting with JDB</a>.</p>
<p>The JDI reference implementations provides several connectors that
map to the available transport types and the modes of connection
(launching, listening, and attaching). These connectors are described in
the following sections. A <code>List</code> containing these connectors
is returned by the JDI method
<code>VirtualMachineManager.allConnectors()</code>. In addition, each
attaching, listening, and launching connector is contained in the lists
returned by the corresponding <code>VirtualMachineManager</code> methods
<code>attachingConnectors()</code>, <code>listeningConnectors()</code>,
and <code>launchingConnectors()</code>.</p>
<h4 id="command-line-launching-connector">Command-Line Launching
Connector</h4>
<p>A debugger application can use this connector to launch any VM that
supports the same invocation debugging options as described in the
section <a href="#vm-invocation-options">VM Invocation Options</a>. The
details of launching the VM and specifying the necessary debug options
are handled by the connector. The underlying transport used by this
connector depends on the platform. On Windows, the shared memory
transport is used. On Linux and macOS, the socket transport is used.</p>
<p>This connector is uniquely identified by the name
<code>com.sun.jdi.CommandLineLaunch</code>.<br />

Allow the debugger to connect only from addresses 192.168.1.00 -
192.168.1.255 and from the local machine by IPv6 address (::1).
Terminate if the debugger does not attach within 5 seconds. Suspend this
VM before main class loads (<code>suspend=y</code> by default). Once the
debugger application connects, it can send a JDWP command to resume the
VM.
</dd>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,server=y,suspend=n</code></dt>
<dd>
Choose an available shared memory transport address and print it to
stdout. Listen for a shared memory connection at that address. Allow the
VM to begin executing before the debugger application attaches.
</dd>
<dd>
<br />

</dd>
<dt><code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=myhost:8000</code></dt>
<dd>
Attach to a running debugger application via socket on host myhost on
port 8000. Suspend this VM before the main class loads.
</dd>
<dd>
<br />

</dd>
<dt><code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,address=mysharedmemory</code></dt>
<dd>
Attach to a running debugger application via shared memory at transport
address <code>mysharedmemory</code>. Suspend this VM before the main
class loads.
</dd>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt><code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=192.168.1.18:8000,allow=*,onthrow=java.io.IOException,launch=/usr/local/bin/debugstub</code></dt>
<dd>
Wait for an instance of <code>java.io.IOException</code> to be thrown in
this VM. Suspend the VM (<code>suspend=y</code> by default). Listen for
a socket connection at address 192.168.1.18 on port 8000. Allow the
debugger to connect from any address. Execute the following:
"<code>/usr/local/bin/debugstub dt_socket myhost:8000".</code>This
program can launch a debugger process in a separate window which will
attach to this VM and begin debugging it.
</dd>
<dd>
<br />

</dd>
<dt><code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,server=y,onuncaught=y,launch=d:\bin\debugstub.exe</code></dt>
<dd>
Wait for an uncaught exception to be thrown in this VM. Suspend the VM.
Select a shared memory transport address and listen for a connection at
that address. Execute the following:
"<code>d:\bin\debugstub.exe dt_shmem &lt;address&gt;"</code>, where
<code>&lt;address&gt;</code> is the selected shared memory address. This
program can launch a debugger process in a separate window which will
attach to this VM and begin debugging it.

<h3 id="connecting-with-jdb">Connecting with JDB</h3>
<p>The example implementation of the Java Debugger (JDB) provided with
the JPDA, provides an illustration of the usage of JDI connectors. There
are "shortcut" options to JDB which assume the use of connectors known
to it (that is, connectors present in the reference implementation). It
also provides a way to establish a general connection using any
connector. While JDB is hardly an example of a good debugger interface,
it does provide a simple example of connectors in use.</p>
<p>In JDB, the <code>-attach</code> option provides access to one of the
attaching connectors in the reference implementation (shared memory on
Windows, sockets on Linux and macOS). The <code>-listen</code> option
provides access to one of the listening connectors in the reference
implementation (shared memory on Windows, sockets on Linux and macOS). A
class name and arguments specified directly on the command line provide
access to the command line launching connector.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>jdb -attach myhost:8000</code></p>
<p>is an easy way to attach to a target VM with the socket attaching
connector (on Linux on macOS), and</p>
<p><code>jdb Hello 1 2 3</code></p>
<p>is an easy way to launch a target VM with the command-line launching
connector.</p>
<p>However, the <code>-connect</code> option is also provided by JDB to
handle any connector by taking an connector name and a set of arbitrary
name-value argument pairs. For example, the previous command lines have
the following equivalents:</p>
<p><code>jdb -connect com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:hostname=myhost,port=8000</code><br />
<code>jdb -connect "com.sun.jdi.CommandLineLaunch:main=Hello 1 2 3"</code></p>
<p>These command lines are more cumbersome than the ones above, but the
<code>-connect</code> option can be used with any connector. This kind
of operation is a primitive example of how a JDI debugger can deal with
any kind of connector while providing a simplified interface for dealing
with common, well-known connectors.</p>

<h3 id="service-provider-interfaces">Service Provider Interfaces</h3>
<p>JPDA includes service provider interfaces to allow the development
and deployment of connector and transport implementations. These service
provider interfaces allow debugger and other tool vendors to develop new
connector implementations and provide addition transport mechanisms over
and beyond the socket and shared memory transport provided by Oracle.
The service provider interfaces in JDI are specified in the <a
href="../../api/jdk.jdi/com/sun/jdi/connect/spi/package-summary.html">com.sun.jdi.connect.spi</a>
package.</p>
<p>In addition to the service provider interfaces in JDI, the Oracle
implementation also includes a transport library interface called the <a
href="../jdwp/jdwp-transport.html">Java Debug Wire Protocol Transport
Interface</a>. A transport library is loaded by the JDWP agent in the
target VM and is used to establish a connection to the debugger and to
transport JDWP packets between the debugger and the VM.</p>
